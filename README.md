# Welcome! Let's get started
A. Download the Repository:
   1. Click "Code..." > "Download as ZIP".
   2. Then, once downloaded, extract the ZIP to any folder you wish.
B. Install the App
   1. Run the install script using: `install.py`. If you installed via Pi-Apps, skip this step and proceed.
   2. Open the app at *Menu > Apps > Software Store*, or by running command `softwarestore`.
C. Use the App
   1. To navigate the Software Store app, it is simple, here's how: at the 'top' of the app, there is a navbar, on that navbar you will see: search bar; a menu icon; a few tabs ("Home", "Apps", "Music", etc.). Each of these has its own part of the puzzle. The search bar lets you search everything, apps only, or music only. The Tabs provide a quick navigation to each of these sections (Home, Apps, Music, etc.). The Menu Icon opens the Options Menu where more is listed (including Settings).
D. To download a Software Store app, follow these instructions:
   1. Find the app
   2. Press "Download"
   3. Press "I accept" to the acknowledgment
   4. Either press "Open" or go to the app on your OS
   5. That's it! You're ready to use the app!

Hope you enjoy!
